# Excel_FMCG_Project
I worked on a project from FMCG retail industry. FMCG stands for fast moving consumer goods.
These are the products that we use in our day-to-day life. Some of the fmcg products are milk,
bread, butter, biscuits, shampoo, toothpaste, etc.

The objective of this project was to analyze data and create an interactive dashboard for business
to make informed decisions based on key metrics.

I worked on this project into 4 phases.

1) Understanding Requirements: 
In this phase I spent time to understand what was expected from this project. I also listed the key
business questions that could be answered.

3) Understanding the FMCG industry:
In this phase, I did an intense research to understand the fmcg industry, overall market size,
expected growth, India vs global fmcg market, top 3 fmcg companies across geography, top 3 Indian
fmcg companies, and rural vs urban market in India.

5) Defined Metrics
Based on key business questions, I defined a set of business metrics for the dashboard and decided to create 2 dashboards. 

a) Business Performance Dashboard: to report key business metrics. and
b) Orders Dashboard to report orders across categories

4) Data cleansing, preparation, and analysis
Finally, I did the cleaning by removing unnecessary rows and columns. I also derived new columns like product category
based on product name, and Quarter, month, and year based on purchase date.

Then I created pivot tables based on the metrics that I defined in previous phase and created charts based on these pivot tables.

I also used slicer to connect pivot tables and to make the dashboard, dynamic.

At the end I generated insights from the dashboards and got sign-off.
